He doesn't have to keep stopping, because every action he performs, is calculated in such a way that some later action can put it right to the extent that it is imperfect now. What is critical here, is the <a href="#" class="article-link is-visited">sequence of events</a>. The carpenter never takes a step which he cannot correct later; so he can keep working, confidently, steadily.</p>
