      The <a href="#" class="article-link" target="_blank">essence of this process</a> is very fundamental indeed. We may understand it best by comparing the work of a fifty-year-old carpenter with the work of a novice. The <a href="some.pdf" class="article-link">experienced carpenter</a> keeps going. He doesn't have to keep stopping, because every action he performs, is calculated in such a way that some later action can put it right to the extent that it is imperfect now. What is critical here, is the <a href="#" class="article-link is-visited">sequence of events</a>. The carpenter never takes a step which he cannot correct later; so he can keep working, confidently, steadily.</p>
